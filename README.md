_Your primary source of air on a bag!_

## Brief

This is a product landing demo webpage.

It includes many comical remarks regarding the fact that this fictitious company pretends to be selling bags filled with luxurious air.

## Features

- SVG primitive filters for a particle effect on the prices for the products on hover. This took a while and is my favorite part of the demo.
